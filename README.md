# üß† King Living Orders Dashboard ‚Äì Full Stack POC

This project is a full-stack proof-of-concept dashboard for King Living that aggregates and displays real-time order data from three commerce regions: APAC, UK, and US. It is built using **React + Vite + TypeScript** on the frontend, and **Node.js + Express + MongoDB** on the backend.

---

## üì¶ Tech Stack

### Frontend

- Vite + React + TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- Luxon (timezone/date handling)
- Signals (state management)

### Backend

- Node.js (v18+)
- Express.js
- MongoDB with Mongoose
- Joi (validation)
- Morgan (logging)
- Helmet, CORS (security)

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup & Run Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Node.js v18+
- MongoDB (local or Atlas)
- (Optional) Redis for caching

### Clone Repositories

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hadi-roudaki/Dashboard-POC.git
cd Dashboard-POC
```

## üîß Backend Setup

```bash
cd server
npm install
```

Create .env // copy the values in .env.exxample

```bash
// to generate fake data
node scripts/generateOrders.js
```

## üíª Frontend Setup

```bash
cd ../client
npm install
```

Create .env // copy the values in .env.exxample

```bash
npm run dev
```

# üß† AI Prompts Used During Development

- "Build me a React + vite dashboard that shows live-updating order values from three commerce regions, each using a different currency and timezone."

- "Generate TypeScript types for an order system with customer, shipping address, and item details."

- Generate a README.md for a React + Node.js orders dashboard app with AI prompt history, setup instructions, and technical decisions."

- "I need to implement a scalable backend for a furniture order dashboard with regions (APAC, UK, US) that handles different currencies and timezones. The data should be filterable."

# üí° Technical Design Decisions

### Frontend

- Vite for fast development experience.
- Tailwind for quick and responsive UI.
- Luxon for precise, timezone-aware timestamps.
- Signals for state management across components.
- Paginated, auto-refreshing table to balance UX and performance.

### Backend

- Embedded Order Items: Kept items inside order documents to reduce join complexity.
- Base Currency Storage: Stored values in smallest currency unit (e.g., cents) to avoid float errors.
- UTC + Region Metadata: Used UTC for storage, timezone logic handled at the response level.
- Offset-based Pagination: Easy to implement, works well with table UIs, and scales with indexed queries.

# üîç Assumptions Made

3,000‚Äì5,000 orders per region.
80% read-heavy usage, primarily for dashboard views.
Each region has a unique currency: AUD (APAC), GBP (UK), USD (US).
Auto-refresh interval is 10 seconds for near real-time feel.
No authentication layer (assumed handled upstream).

# ü§ñ Reflection on Using AI in the Dev Process

## ‚úÖ Helpful

Speed: Rapid prototyping of frontend UI, backend schema, and API structure.

Bug Fixing: Quicker identification and resolution of common errors (e.g., WebSocket issues, Mongoose config).

Modern Patterns: Provided best practices (e.g., storing currency in smallest unit, REST pagination strategy).

Writing Support: Helped generate types, documentation, and boilerplate.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Hindrances

Outdated Suggestions: Occasionally referenced deprecated packages/APIs (e.g., Faker.js).

Over-Engineering: Sometimes introduced overly complex architecture.

Shallow Debugging: Some fixes were generic and required deeper manual exploration.

üéØ Overall Impact
Using AI reduced development time by approximately 40% and helped improve code quality and architecture awareness.
